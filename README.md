# xri-two-hands

This project was created for Unity's Hackweek 2021. I worked in a team to prototype custom scripts to enable `Dynamic Attach Points`, and `Multi Grabbable Objects` that create more realistic two-handed interactions.

Personally, I worked on creating a bow and arrow interaction, as well as a hockey stick interaction. I also helped iterate on the custom scripts to allow for more flexibility when creating two-handed interactions. I also worked on creating custom animated hands to simulate grabbing and trigger interactions.

Below is a demo of all the interactions featured in this repo:

You can try it yourself on Oculus Quest 2 by downloading the build [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JBww-QOU9O5tGu4pZjiGOaWTlVwzdslC/view?usp=sharing).

Moving forward, I hope to integrate some of these concepts and ideas into future projects to create more realistic and flexible interactions in XR.
