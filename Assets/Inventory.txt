	VRTemplate/Scenes/SampleScene

	XRISampleProject/Scenes/WorldInteractionDemo - The demo main demo scene, with little stands/kiosks for each feature

	DOTSample/Scenes/Whitebox_* - Scenes of different environment setups.  Teleporters currently inactive. XR setups put in place but scene geo not yet wired for locomotion.
